Come on down, off of your cloud
Why just be a face in the crowd
You can remember that once upon a love affair
Your heart was warm, your lips were tender; and I didn't care, baby

(You're gonna see)
You're gonna see
(A brand new me)
A brand new me
(It's you that's on my mind this time)
I really love you
(I'll be around, I'll never let you down)
Won't be the same
(Can't you see my feet are on the ground)

I've had my fill of foolin' around
Ain't no life just being a clown
And I heard the weather report and it said sunny today
How did he know that you would show up to love each day baby

(You're gonna see)
You're gonna see
(A brand new me)
A brand new me
(It's you that's on my mind this time)
I really love you
(I'll be around, I'll never let you down)
Won't be the same
(Can't you see my feet are on the ground)

(You're gonna see)
(A brand new me)
(It's you that's on my mind this time)
(I'll be around, I'll never let you down)
(Can't you see my feet are on the ground)

(You're gonna see)
(A brand new me)
(It's you that's on my mind this time)
(I'll be around, I'll never let you down)
